# <h1 align="center">Hi, I’m Lauta ⚡</h1>

I build and study systems with a focus on **clarity, structure, and long-term reliability**.

I don’t rush learning, and I don’t memorize blindly.
I prefer to understand *why things work*, how they fail, and how they behave over time.

My current focus sits at the intersection of:

 **Python & software systems**
 
 **AI engineering (LLMs, RAG, agents)**
 
 **Operational thinking (lifecycle, drift, monitoring)**
 

I learn by **studying while building**, using projects as reality checks.



## Current Direction

 Designing and implementing **AI-powered systems**
 
 Learning **modern AI architecture** 
 
 Understanding **production realities**: failure modes, monitoring, lifecycle
 
 Using AI as a *thinking partner*, not a shortcut

The landscape has clearly changed, and I’m trying to align with where systems are heading somehow.



## Principles

 **Clarity and depth before speed**
 
 **Structure before scale**
 
 **Study + application**
 
 **Functionality and aesthetics are not separate**
 
 **Signal over noise**
