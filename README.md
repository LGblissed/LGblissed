# Hello there, I'm Lauta ⚡

I'm a beginner Python developer with no rush but consistency.  
I don’t like to learn by rapidly memorising stuff — I like to understand things with clarity and keep an open mind throughout the process.  

I'm starting my journey doing some courses on Coursera:  
- Microsoft’s Python Fundamentals (first)  
- Google’s (future)  
- And who knows what’ll come next 🚀  

I'm an AI enthusiast, music is my energy booster, and I love art, sports and nature.  

## Goals 🎯
- Learn and understand Python as deep as I can.  
- Use AI to help me dive deep even in simple concepts, so I can gain many viewpoints.  
- Combine **functionality** with **aesthetics**.  
- For me, it's all about connection.  

✨ *so, I hope to connect with you!* ✨
